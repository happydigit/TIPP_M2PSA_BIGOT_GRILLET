# TIPP_M2PSA_BIGOT_GRILLET
Study of integrated and transverse momentum differential production rates forparticles emitted in high energy collisions at the LHC  This project is part of the Internship of BIGOT Alexandre and GRILLET Antoine, with superviser HIPPOLYTE Boris and SCHOTTER Romain.  The general goal of this project is to study the production rates for hadron species obtained in proton-proton (pp) and lead-lead (Pbâ€“Pb) collisions at 5.02 TeV per nucleon pair using data collected by theALICE experiment then to compare them to the results of a statistical thermal model thermus  A more specified description of the project is available in the file TIPPHippolyteSchotter.PDF
